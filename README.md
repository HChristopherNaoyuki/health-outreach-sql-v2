# Health Outreach SQL V2

This project sets up and manages a simple health outreach 
scheduling system using SQL Server. It includes schema 
creation, data population, and a variety of useful queries 
for analysis and management.

## Project Overview

The Health Outreach SQL project is designed to simulate a scheduling and reporting system for medical outreach programs. It includes:

* Database creation and schema setup
* Insertions of initial records
* Queries to retrieve insights like booking status, doctor availability, and performance metrics

## Technology Stack

* **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
* **Language**: T-SQL
* **Environment**: SSMS / Azure Data Studio
* **File**: `solutions.sql`

## Project Structure

```
health-outreach-sql-v2/
├── solutions.sql        -- All schema, insert, and query scripts
├── README.md            -- Project documentation
```

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HChristopherNaoyuki/health-outreach-sql-v2.git
   cd health-outreach-sql
   ```

2. Open `solutions.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio.

3. Run the script section by section to:

   * Create and select the database
   * Create all tables
   * Populate data
   * Execute reporting and analytics queries

## Features

* Setup of three core tables: `DOCTOR`, `CLINIC`, `OUTREACH`
* Data integrity via primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
* Insertion of sample data for testing and analytics
* SQL queries for common business scenarios:

  * Doctors without outreach events
  * Total seats per doctor
  * Most attended outreach event per doctor
  * Booking pressure (fill rate ≥ 50%)

## Model Implementation

**Tables:**

* `DOCTOR`: Stores doctor details (name, email, specialty, status)
* `CLINIC`: Stores clinic information (name, address)
* `OUTREACH`: Tracks outreach events, linking doctors and clinics with event dates, available seats, booking stats, and status

**Constraints:**

* Primary keys on IDs
* Unique constraint on doctor email
* Foreign keys in `OUTREACH`
* CHECK constraints for valid values and ranges

## Controller Implementation

**Data Manipulation Statements:**

* `INSERT INTO` statements populate initial data
* `UPDATE` used for changing seat bookings
* `ALTER TABLE` available for modifying constraints

## View Implementation

**Queries for Reports:**

* Doctors without scheduled outreach
* Total available seats per doctor
* Best clinic for a specific doctor based on seat availability
* Booking fill rate analysis

## Styling and Design

As this is a backend-only SQL implementation, no frontend styling or UI design is included. However, the script is logically structured in sections:

* **Section A**: Database setup and data insertion
* **Section B**: Query-based reporting and analysis
* **Section C**: Indexing and integrity testing (optional)

## Running the Application

1. Execute the script in a SQL Server environment.
2. View results of SELECT statements for each section.
3. Modify or extend the script to suit new business rules or datasets.

This project is educational and intended for demonstration purposes. 
It is not meant for production use in clinical or patient-facing environments. 
Always ensure data protection and compliance when working with real health data.
